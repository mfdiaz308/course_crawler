However, many excellent books and online courses on algorithms, that excel in introducing algorithmic ideas, have not yet succeeded in teaching you how to implement algorithms, the crucial computer science skill that you have to master at your next job interview. We tried to fill this gap by forming a diverse team of instructors that includes world-leading experts in theoretical and applied algorithms at UCSD (Daniel Kane, Alexander Kulikov, and Pavel Pevzner) and a former software engineer at Google (Neil Rhodes). This unique combination of skills makes this Specialization different from other excellent MOOCs on algorithms that are all developed by theoretical computer scientists. While these MOOCs focus on theory, our Specialization is a mix of algorithmic theory/practice/applications with software engineering. You will learn algorithms by implementing nearly 100 coding problems in a programming language of your choice.\u00c2\u00a0To the best of knowledge, no other online course in Algorithms comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges (and puzzles!) that you may face at your next job interview. We invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs.  Applied Learning ProjectThe specialization contains two real-world projects: Big Networks and Genome Assembly. You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco 1000 times faster than the shortest path algorithms you learn in the standard Algorithms 101 course!

Still, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll implement several efficient solutions for real world instances of the travelling salesman problem. While designing these solutions, we will rely heavily on the material learned in the courses of the specialization: proof techniques, combinatorics, probability, graph theory.

Electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces that hold atoms and molecules together, which are the building blocks of any materials.In four courses, you will learn the foundations of electrodynamics starting from the nature of electrical force up to the level of in-depth solutions of Maxwell equations. We will walk you through vector calculus, concepts of field, flux and circulation, electrostatics, and magnetostatics as well as electrodynamics. By the end of this Specialization you will understand four beautiful equations organized by Maxwell in a full picture. Special relativity will be covered as well to grasp the idea that magnetism is a relativistic effect of electricity. The approach taken in this Specialization complements traditional approaches, covering a fairly complete treatment of the physics of electricity and magnetism, and adds Feynman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique and vital approach of grasping a whole picture of the physical universe. In addition, this Specialization uniquely bridges the gap between the knowledge of electrodynamics and its practical applications to research in materials science, information technology, electrical engineering, chemistry, chemical engineering, energy storage, energy harvesting, and other materials related fields. Applied Learning ProjectThe purpose behind this particular project is learning to apply the concepts of Electrodynamics. Therefore, we ask you to apply the equations and concepts you learned designing or improving a process relating to your own work or a topic you are interested in.You will have a chance to write a short paper on any research topic that uses the knowledge you learned in this Specialization.

The American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) established that the crash most probably was caused by the flight crew's (in)actions. Three teenage girls lost their lives; two in the airplane and another was accidentally run over by a firetruck.The human factor is often cause for accidents. NTSB and others report that more than 50 percent of plane crashes is caused by pilot error (and for road accidents it is even 90 perc.) Correctly designed safety and security critical systems can prevent these errors.After following this course successfully, you are able to develop secure embedded systems that are at the core of these safety and security critical systems. You are even challenged to program your own landing guiding system in our capstone project. If you are interested in building secure embedded systems for the benefit of humanity, this specialization is for you!EIT Digital has chosen 3 MOOC topics of industrial interest, namely: 1) Embedded design and hardware, 2) Security in embedded connectivity and 3) Real-Time systems. These MOOCs show what it takes to program Internet-of-Things systems. We focus on tools used in the modern IoT industry, and we push for a practical learn-by-programming approach in which you are exposed to the actual development in an early stage.We hope to see you soon!Applied Learning ProjectOur project is a practical programming assignment in which the learner combines the knowledge from our three courses. The learner will develop a real embedded IoT system based on the FreeRTOS platform from Wittenstein Ltd. It is a true engineering task in which the learner must apply both their skills and creativity to build a functioning large scale embedded system.",

It starts with common challenges and human resource issues faced by private business.  It then teaches you essential financial accounting skills for entrepreneurs, such as creating and interpreting cash flow, balance sheet, and income statements to make financial health conclusions.This specialization also presents an exciting new approach to values-driven leadership development in the workplace, in business education, and in life.  In an action oriented introduction to Giving Voice to Values (GVV), it is not about persuading people to be more ethical, but instead starts from the premise that most of us already want to act on our values, and we feel that we have a reasonable chance of doing so effectively.  It then discusses the emergence of a new story about business, contextualizing it within a societal framework.  Finally, it teaches you to write innovative business plans, by driving meaningful focus, forcing specificity, and bringing linkages between key business drivers to the foreground.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will go from implementing financial accounting applications to an action oriented introduction to Giving Voice to Values (GVV) to writing innovative business plans, over the course of this specialization.

This question guides Fandom and Popular Culture in the Digital Age. In our networked and information-saturated world, three vital needs emerge: representing identity in digital media, interrogating the products of culture, and engaging meaningfully with digital communities. This course addresses these needs by inviting you into a space of reflection at the intersection of fandom, popular culture, and digital media. More than at any point in human history, these forces have put at our fingertips the means to create and disseminate ourselves in the world. We will explore the products of popular culture and trace the fan networks that sustain and derive value from them. Along the way, we will train you to recognize relationships between popular culture and the political and commercial forces that shape its publication, distribution, and consumption. This course will equip you with the tools necessary to boost your digital media fluency and define, shape, and evolve your identity as a fan within digital spaces. But ultimately, this is a celebration - a celebration of you and your communities, what you love, and how that love might bring people together to change the world. Together, we can make this a community-driven online resource for our shared endeavor of analyzing and understanding fandom and popular culture.Applied Learning ProjectThe projects across this specialization challenge learners to reflect deeply on their experiences, practice skills of close reading, analysis, and interpretation, and express their fandom in thoughtful and creative ways. Learners will practice digital literacy and professional communication skills through reflecting on their personal fandom in blog-style writing, express their creativity by making something relevant to their fandom, and engage with their fandom directly through online platforms.",

It aims to provide learners with opportunities to understand the complex international setting of global health, the role of important stakeholders and the need for good governance in global health. Learners will be introduced to some of the most important challenges to global health and their implications in global health practice. Learners will discuss the main drivers of global health challenges, including global change and globalisation, and consider issues of inequity surrounding the impact of these challenges.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Learners will explore how the capacity to influence health determinants, status and outcomes cannot be assured through national actions alone because of the intensification of cross-border and trans-border flows of vectors, people, goods, services and ideas. By the end of the specialisation, learners should be able to effectively advocate, to a wide range of audiences, for specific action/s on topical global health challenges and propose evidence-informed measures that could be introduced to mitigate the impacts on health.This specialisation will explore in depth two global health challenges; migration and climate change. The Climate change and health course was developed in collaboration with Imperial College's Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the EnvironmentOpens in a new tab. Applied Learning ProjectIn the Globalisation and health governance course, learners will conduct a literature review to evaluate evidence on a global health challenge (GHC) of their choice. Learners will explore a GHC they find interesting, and learn to critically evaluate evidence on it. In Migration and health, learners will create an infographic on a GHC of their choice to communicate with the public and stakeholders. Public engagement is a key competency in global health and this will help learners distill knowledge from sources and convey complex ideas to a general audience.In Climate change and health, learners will write a policy brief on a GHC of their choice, to communicate research or recommendations to policymakers. At the end of this course learners will submit a Capstone project, which consolidates the three previous projects into a cohesive whole, in which learners critically analyse a GHC using different lenses. We recommend using the same GHC throughout the specialisation.",

In order to do this they will analyse good and poor examples, write and review pitch scripts, and study the science of persuasion. Aditionally, learners will evaluate and discuss specific healthcare innovations from around the globe by applying the knowledge they've acquired on innovation features, innovation types, intellectual property, adoption and scaleability.

A person who wants to know more about cannabis and CBD might be:A patient or their loved one who wants to understand the potential risks and benefits.A health care provider who wants to communicate with patients about cannabis.Someone who wants to work in the cannabis industry.Why do people want to know more about cannabis? The legalization of cannabis (i.e., marijuana) and the recent federal legalization of\ncannabidiol (CBD) has led to unprecedented access to cannabinoids (e.g. THC and CBD), a projected 60 billion dollar industry (cannabis and hemp) by 2025, and the fastest growing jobs sector in the economy according to recent reports in the media. Despite all of this, there is very little evidence-based information about the health effects of cannabis or about how to maximize the potential benefits while minimizing harm. Parents of children with seizure disorders, veterans with PTSD and chronic pain, cancer patients, and our aging parents deserve better. People WANT evidence-based information about the potential risks and benefits of cannabis products so that they can weigh the pros and cons of cannabis and CBD versus other options. They also want to know how to maximize the positive effects of cannabis while minimizing the side effects. This specialization is designed to provide that information.Applied Learning ProjectAssignments are experiential in nature and designed to provide students with specific skills regardless of their age or their reasons for taking the specialization (to be an educated patient, continuing education for health care providers, or to obtain a job in the industry). Students will engage with dispensaries, healthcare providers, and/or patients on important questions related to the safety and health effects of cannabis and CBD.  For example, students might visit two dispensaries, ask questions about the safety and health effects of products, and compare answers across the dispensaries. Students might also discuss cannabis with their doctor and compare answers. Students will also consolidate learning  with the creation of infographics. Creating evidence-based infographics is not only a great learning tool, it also provides a skill that is highly desirable among job applicants in the cannabis industry and in public health and public policy positions.

The specialization is particularly useful to anyone working in the healthcare industry who either has: 1)  a developing interest in the issues important to the administration of healthcare organization operations; or 2) some expertise, but wishes an overview or refresher of the issues.  However, those who do not work in the healthcare industry, but who interact with healthcare organizations of any type as patients/consumers will also find the specialization informative.  Through the four courses in the specialization, you will cover many aspects of healthcare organization operations including the relationship between healthcare organizations and the health system as well as health care delivery, business process management, and quality improvement within healthcare organizations.  Upon completion of the specialization, those who interact with healthcare organizations as patients/consumers will have a better understanding of the issues involved in the effective administration of healthcare organizations and operations.  Those working in the healthcare industry, upon completion of the specialization, will be better able to contribute to the effective administration of the healthcare organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations.

The peer-review feature is chosen because each project is presented from the perspective of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of that organization.  One skill required of all CEOs is the ability to present their thinking and conclusions to others and expect evaluation and feedback.  Another skill required of all CEOs is the ability to critically evaluate the presentation, thinking, and conclusions of others.  The format of the communication/presentation is different for each course and reflects communication/presentation strategies of importance to CEOs of healthcare organizations.    ",

Learn more about the ME-EM program at https://www.coursera.org/degrees/me-engineering-management-boulder.Applied Learning ProjectEach week students will explore leadership topics through knowledge-check quizzes, readings, and responding to a real life leadership scenario with a one page paper. The leadership scenario responses are graded on an understanding of the topic, application of your strengths and personality type and a professionally written response. These one page responses will be graded by 3 peer reviewers against a rubric. Writing a very good one-page paper can be more difficult than writing a much longer piece. This is one of the most important and practical types of writing to master. Being a peer reviewer encourages you to be a critical thinker and enhances your communication skills. Peer reviews teach you how to communicate positive and constructive feedback, a critical leadership skill.",

The specialization is meant to prepare the students to work on complex machine learning projects in finance that often require both a broad understanding of the whole field of ML, and understanding of appropriateness of different methods available in a particular sub-field of ML (for example, Unsupervised Learning) for addressing practical problems they might encounter in their work.

This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.Applied Learning ProjectThrough the assignments of this specialisation you will use the skills you have learned to produce mini-projects with Python on interactive notebooks, an easy to learn tool which will help you apply the knowledge to real world problems.

Fortunately there are new and developing treatments which may cure some and improve survival for many people living with serious illness. However, seriously ill people and their loved ones still experience many distressing physical symptoms as well as spiritual, social and psychological distress. There is much we can do to support people to live well with serious and life-limiting illness by understanding the causes of suffering, using effective communications, and incorporating careful assessments and interventions designed to address specific needs. The Palliative Care: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not Just Hospice Specialization covers core concepts on the nature of suffering and demonstrates how to evaluate suffering and illustrates this in realistic patient scenarios. In subsequent weeks we learn and practice specific skills to improve communication with patients and families to help them express their experience, express and understand their core goals and values and our own empathic response. You will also learn about specific problems such as physical pain, fatigue and shortness of breath as well as psychological issues such as depression and anxiety. In addition, spiritual and social distress will be discussed with a focus on the practical evaluation and management of these challenges. All of these skills will enable you to support people to live active and full lives despite serious illness.    Applied Learning ProjectLearners will use real-world strategies, tools and techniques to assess sources of suffering and learn communication techniques that support patients living with serious illness. Authentic patient scenarios are used to allow learners to apply new knowledge and practice new skills that they can then apply and integrate into their own clinical settings.    ",

Hundreds of plant genomes have been sequenced, RNA-seq has enabled transcriptome-wide expression profiling, and a proliferation of \"-seq\"-based methods has permitted protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to be determined cheaply and in a high-throughput manner. These data sets in turn allow us to generate hypotheses at the click of a mouse or tap of a finger.The Plant Bioinformatics Specialization on Coursera introduces core bioinformatic competencies and resources, such as NCBI's Genbank, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics in Bioinformatic Methods I, followed by protein-protein interaction, structural bioinformatics and RNA-seq analysis in Bioinformatic Methods II. In Plant Bioinformatics we cover 33 plant-specific online tools from genome browsers to transcriptomic data mining to promoter/network analyses and others. Last, a Plant Bioinformatics Capstone uses these tools to hypothesize a biological role for a gene of unknown function, summarized in a written lab report.This specialization is useful to any modern plant molecular biologist wanting to get a feeling for the incredible scope of data available to researchers.

        "description": "Welcome to this specialization about privacy and standardisation, We are thrilled to see that you are interested and will provide you with a comprehensive study of the intriguiging subject of privacy and standardisation in the context of technological innovation. We hope this course will enthuse you to look further into privacy, personal data regulation and standardisation. Especially in the light of recent events it becomes more important to know about  your (alleged!?) rights and freedoms. The courses on privacy provide you with a historical perspective on the developments of privacy rights in an international context. The course on standardisation shows you the legal context and the scalable power of standardisation. Both topics are presented in a technological context. The course on Privacy in the Western World provides you with the differences between the USA and Europe, and the details of Europe and USA will be explained extensively in the follow-up courses.The specialization will help you build a comprehensive opinion and it will challenge you in all areas of present-day privacy protection. It will link historic milestones to current limitations and offer you a journey through jurisdictions and technological fields alike.Through video lectures and quizzes we endeavor to build a solid foundation for you to construct a well-founded opinion on privacy and standardisation. Last but not least we sincerely hope you enjoy the course! Prof.mr.dr. Jan SmitsApplied Learning ProjectThe capstone assignments will require you to carefully consider all you have learned in the 4 courses about privacy and standardisation and detail your opinion. The assessment in this course will mainly be done by in-depth assignments. Use the few practice exercises well to give you a head start in the graded assignments!",

It has four main objectives:To inspire you to codeTo help you think in codeTo teach you technical concepts to codeTo give you useful examples of things to do in codeThere is a steep learning curve on learning to code, and that is why this Specialization emphasizes motivation. You have to want to learn to code and stick with it through multiple learning activities and your own experimentation, research, and practice. This single Specialization will not teach you to code. It will, however, get you started with a mindset for coding, understanding of Python technical concepts, and an appreciation of what can be done with Python to access and interact with data on the Internet. These skills are increasingly essential for researchers.The wealth of data that is now available to researchers who can use Python and other tools to access it is transforming academic disciplines, including the social sciences. But there's a gap between the questions about human nature that we know internet data can cast light on, and the raw, messy reality of code and data. Each course in this Specialization has code demonstrations that you run that show how to use Python to bridge the gap and to discover things about ourselves, our friends, each other, and society, as we interact with the Internet in code. We look forward to being a part of your continuing education! Applied Learning ProjectWhile no formal requisites are necessary to join this specialization, you will be accessing and completing assignments in Jupyter Notebooks using the programming language Python in various APIs.

        "description": "The Real-Time Embedded Systems specialization is a series of four course taking you from a beginning practitioner, to a more advanced real-time system analyst and designer.  Knowledge and experience gained on hard to master topics such as predictable response services, when to allocate requirements to hardware or software, as well as mission critical design will enhance your engineering talent.  You will gain experience building a simple, but real, system project with real-time challenges, that will boost your confidence.   The hands-on, at home, project hardware is affordable, widely available, and quick-time-to market  methods leverage Linux  real-time extensions, open source RTOS (Real-Time  Operating System), as well as tried and true cyclic executives.  After you complete all four courses in the series, you can consider yourself an intermediate to more advanced real-time system practitioner.  This knowledge is invaluable for medical, aerospace, transportation, energy, digital entertainment, telecommunications, and other exciting embedded career options.The series stresses hands-on practice and assessment of your learning progress, not only based on knowledge acquisition, but by teaching you to put theory into practice and how to evaluate design options and make optimal choices.  The unique final project allows you to see real-time challenges with your eyes, to debug interactively, and build a simple at-home detection, tracking and synchronization system.Applied Learning ProjectProject work includes a series of real-time processing and concurrency exercises along with analysis and design in the first two courses.  The third course provides experience with mission critical components like error correction code memory, flash file systems, and redundant hardware.  In the final course, you put all of the practice together into your own design to build a real-time system that you can test at home.  The project covers topics including: concurrency, Linux kernel modules, machine vision, co-processors, and correct function with timing constraints.  You will use specific real-time extensions to Linux and compare advantages and disadvantages of Linux to more traditional RTOS, cyclic executive, and FPGA options.  The experience you gain can be used to launch additional exploration of hybrid FPGA systems (e.g. Altera and Xilinx), GP-GPU (e.g. NVIDIA), and multi-core scale-up (e.g. ARM A and R-Series) as well as MCU scale-down solutions (ARM M-Series microprocessors).",

And the contrary is also true: poor heath and unhealthy practices build tall barriers to student learning.The courses of this specialization are designed to equip learners to manage common health conditions including asthma, allergies, diabetes, and seizures. Next they will learn to manage common behavior conditions such as ADHD and autism as well as learning disabilities and concussion. Upon completion of the specialization, learners will be ready to apply newly acquired skills in the provision of social, emotional, behavioral, and special education services. Importantly, they will also be ready to promote healthy practices such as nutrition, physical activity, and community and family participation in their own school community.In pediatric healthcare we do everything possible to ensure the health of children and adolescents but there can be no greater impact on a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health than receiving optimal health condition management and healthy practices in school.Applied Learning ProjectUpon taking this specialization, learners will learn about various components of school health program, such as: Health education, physical education, health services, nutrition services, counseling, psychological, and social services, healthy and safe school environment, and last but not least family/ community involvement.",

This  introduction to the field of sports analytics is designed for sports managers, coaches, physical therapists, as well as sports fans who want to understand the science behind athlete performance and game prediction. New Python programmers and data analysts who are looking for a fun and practical way to apply their Python, statistics, or predictive modeling skills will enjoy exploring courses in this series.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will apply methods and techniques learned to sports datasets to generate their own results rather than relying on the data processing performed by others. As a consequence the learner will be empowered to explore their own ideas about sports team performance, test them out using the data, and so become a producer of sports analytics rather than a consumer.",

This is where you (and this Specialization) come in!In this Specialization you will both learn about the impacts of computing in our world and how to teach these impacts to K-12 students. We offer both the technical knowledge and also the pedagogical approaches for teaching these concepts. Along the way you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll engage with freely available materials you can use in your own classroom, as well as learn from teachers currently teaching these concepts in their classrooms.In short - in this Specialization we'll teach you the computing concepts you need to know and then help you explore and evaluate lesson plans and resources to prepare you for your classroom.Applied Learning ProjectUsing a problem-based approach to understanding underlying computing concepts, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll travel through five different digital \u00e2\u0080\u009cworlds\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which we engage with technology, exploring the problems posed within that world and the various tech solutions that exist.At the end of each world, you will reflect on the effectiveness of your learning process and evaluate lesson plans and materials available for use in your own classroom. Through these activities, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll become a more reflective teacher and develop an understanding of how instruction and activities can be designed to support learning. See FAQ for per-course details.As a culminating project, you will complete part of the new advanced placement computer science course - the \u00e2\u0080\u009cExplore Task\u00e2\u0080\u009d - where you research a recent computing innovation and and analyze its impacts on the world. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll apply the AP grading checklist to sample secondary student work, provide feedback to a fellow learner, and receive the same from fellow learners.",

        "description": "Social and emotional learning, or SEL, programs have flourished in schools during the last decade. These programs vary widely but most share a concern for five individual, student competencies: self awareness; self-management; social awareness; relationship skills; and finally responsible decision making. It is important for teachers and parents to know about and understand these programs. While lots of SEL programs emphasize K-12 student social and emotional learning, only a very few programs exist to promote, and help teachers explore their own emotional well-being. In this Specialization our central premise is this:To facilitate students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 social and emotional learning, a teacher must know the student as a person. This means that the teacher must strive to know her or him self. In order to help students achieve a degree of well-being, teachers need to be aware of their own well-being.In our Specialization, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Teacher and SEL\u00e2\u0080\u009d the instructors (Randy Testa and Dan Liston, as well as Emily Price and Ben Kirshner) examine kindergarten through high school SEL programs, looking at both established programs and less well-known community-based and youth empowerment approaches. Along with this examination of K-12 SEL programs, we bring a much needed emphasis on the teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well being.Applied Learning ProjectStudents will utilize course knowledge and skills to create either a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Teacher Implementation Plan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 focused on developing student or teacher SELprograms, or a cinema project examining student & teacher SEL implications in educationally oriented films.

The goal is for learners to incorporate evaluations of data quality into their process as a critical component for all projects. We sincerely hope to disseminate knowledge about total data quality to all learners, such as data scientists and quantitative analysts, who have not had sufficient training in the initial steps of the data science process that focus on data collection and evaluation of data quality. We feel that extensive knowledge of data science techniques and statistical analysis procedures will not help a quantitative research study if the data collected/gathered are not of sufficiently high quality.This specialization will focus on the essential first steps in any type of scientific investigation using data: either generating or gathering data, understanding where the data come from, evaluating the quality of the data, and taking steps to maximize the quality of the data prior to performing any kind of statistical analysis or applying data science techniques to answer research questions. Given this focus, there will be little material on the analysis of data, which is covered in myriad existing Coursera specializations. The primary focus of this specialization will be on understanding and maximizing data quality prior to analysis. Applied Learning ProjectLearners will gain valuable and applicable knowledge and skills about the Total Data Quality framework from interviews with leading experts in this area, engaging lectures, live demonstrations of concepts using software and case studies, and will complete practical assessments to solidify concepts and reinforce essential ideas.",

The specialization consists of 4 courses that are composed of a basic part with lectures and quizzes, and a practical  \"honors\" part, which includes physically assembling and implementing functionality atop a networked device (please note: while the honors part of the courses is optional, it is required to purchase hardware to complete these practical parts of the courses). The courses are meant to be taken in sequence, as each course builds on the previous one, while adding more functions to the device in the honors section. The construction of the device introduces real-world challenges and technological approaches commonly encountered in the IoT industry and builds students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 confidence that they can do things for real.Applied Learning ProjectLearners will be introduced to the concepts and technologies in Internet of Things. In the (optional) Honors section, we will build an actual small self-driving vehicle, using networking and sensor technologies. Throughout the honors parts of the four courses, the vehicle will become more refined, gaining capabilities such as environmental sensing, computer vision, autonomous driving, cloud-based analytics, and more. Again, we need to mention that a prerequisite to complete this part of the courses is a basic kit of hardware that you need to purchase. If you don't want to complete the honors parts, you don't need the hardware.",
