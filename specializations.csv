Simultaneously, we consider the data that are used to construct such estimates. We then consider the role of social determinants and risk factors in shaping the distribution of disease in populations. For each, the overall aetiology and epidemiological patterns are described and subsequently, the interventions that are available to combat them are considered. Particular \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98policy issues\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 in relation to each disease are examined from multiple angles. Each session comprises lecture content with leaders in the field, practical activities and in-depth interview with subject matter experts. The specialisation will give students a broad understanding of the major global issues in health and an in-depth understanding of some of the most important disease challenges that are being faced today. It will equip public health professionals and researchers with a broad foundation of knowledge on which to build further expertise about global public health.'"

Throughout the courses, an accessible, scientific approach is embraced such that best practices and practical tips are informed by research, but presented in accessible, applied ways.\\n\\nUpon completing the specialization, learners will have a deeper understanding of what works in the workplace, including a toolkit of best practices for hiring, managing, and rewarding employees.\\n\\nThe specialization will be valuable for managers and entrepreneurs taking on these responsibilities as well as anyone else interested in the fundamental principles of human resource management. The Capstone Project will provide an opportunity to apply this knowledge to a real situation, including your own organization or work unit if desired.'"

Machine learning engineering for production combines the foundational concepts of machine learning with the functional expertise of modern software development and engineering roles.\\n\\nThe Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization covers how to conceptualize, build, and maintain integrated systems that continuously operate in production. In striking contrast with standard machine learning modeling, production systems need to handle relentless evolving data. Moreover, the production system must run non-stop at the minimum cost while producing the maximum performance. In this Specialization, you will learn how to use well-established tools and methodologies for doing all of this effectively and efficiently.\\n\\nIn this Specialization, you will become familiar with the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of machine learning engineering in production.
