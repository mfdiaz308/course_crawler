It\x03s a human institution trying to start something new under extreme conditions of uncertainty, says author Eric Ries. It\x03s not that some founders have better ideas than others, and this is what dictates success. What differentiates a successfully launched enterprise is one who can unearth the best ideas under duress - those who can find &quot;the pivot&quot;- the point of reinvention when they realize that their original ideas need retooling. And, more critically, that they can find their market before they run out of money.\\n'"

Have you been wondering what all the buzz is about? Have you heard about all the open source software projects moving to Github? Have you been thinking that it\'s time to give Git a try yourself? We think it is too, and we think this course will help.\\nThis course is a different approach to learning Git than, say, reading online documentation or buying a book on Git because you\'ll see not only how Git works, but how you should work with Git. We\'ll show you the situations that you probably find yourself in as a developer all the time and how Git can help you work faster, work with more confidence, and save yourself and your teammates time by supporting a good workflow. We\'ll show you how Git works in practice, and also how to practice Git.\\nIn this first session we\'ll cover getting started with Git and daily workflow which will become second nature to you. We\'ll get it in your fingers. Not only that, but all the operations we\'ll use Git for will be completely local to our own systems.\\nOne of the things that first piques people\'s interest in Git is that it\'s distributed. They wonder what that means and how it affects them. In later sessions we\'ll understand the answers to questions about the distributed nature of Git, but one side effect of it is that many of Git\'s operations are completely local to your own computer. A Git repository can live out a useful and completely local life all on one computer, and we\'ll see that side of working with Git.\\nWhen this session is complete you\'ll understand:\\nGit has no particular need to work with any repository than the local one on your computer, unlike many other version control systems but that wouldn\'t be very fun would it? Git really becomes useful when you and your team members use it to facilitate collaborating on a project. We\'ll start to understand what it means that Git is distributed.\\nOne of the first things people wonder when they hear that Git is distributed, or that Git doesn\'t need a central server, is ""Can I still have a central server for my team?"". Of course you can, and many teams still work the same way they have with other versioning systems. We\'ll see how to do that as well as share changes with another computer directly. We\'ll set up an account on Github and use that to learn how to deal with remote repositories.\\nWe\'ll also learn about very important concept in version control systems: branching. Git makes branching so easy that it\'s time to learn how you should be integrating branching into your workflow.\\nWhen this session is complete you\'ll understand:\\nSession three is all about the how Git works and how you work with Git out there in the wild.\\nChances are you first heard about Git and Github almost in the same sentence. In fact sometimes it\'s easy to forget that Github is just a logical extension to Git itself.\\nGithub is a wildly popular way to host and collaborate on Open Source software projects using Git. Some of the most important software tools you may use every day are now hosted or mirrored on Github, such as Rails, jQuery, or Postgres. Github\'s unique philosophy on forking, or branching off developement on a software project, makes it easy for anyone to contribute to their favorite open source tools. We\'ll dig deeper into how to work with Github.\\nNext we\'ll go over a whole list of interesting tools Git gives you work a lot faster. Interactive adding, adding using patch mode, interactive merging, and some advanced logging and querying techniques for finding exactly what\'s been going on in your repository.\\nWe\'ll also cover a very important topic in software development: ""screwing things up"". Not only do we often really mess up the project we\'re working on, we can also make mistakes in Git itself. Luckily Git is there to help with both of those kinds of problems. Git provides ways to not only commit changes, which is helpful in itself to any software project, but also to fix, reorder, play back, cherry pick, and recover lost commits.\\nWhen this session is complete you\'ll understand:\\n'"

""Discover How to Get Any Local Business to Page 1 of Google In Less Than 30 Days, Beat Out the Local Competition & Get More Calls, Leads & Sales Online!"" And right now you are about to get access to the exact training course that you can use to do it fast! It\'s literally step by step... \\nIf you are a local business owner or online/offline marketer you probably realize that Google is a goldmine IF you can tap into it.\\nAnd until recently, when a consumer typed a keyword phrase into Google there were just 10 results on the 1st page and that was it. You were competing with the entire country for 10 spots on that coveted first page. And that just wasn\'t gonna happen! Not without spending big bucks on SEO!\\nAnd top it all off. IF you are still advertising in the telephone book, you realize that the phone book has died. You are not getting nearly as many calls as you once did and you don\'t know how to replace that income. You probably realize the internet is the key but where do you start?\\nWell, here\'s the deal...\\nJust 10 short years ago, over 90% of all consumers went straight to their phone book to find the products & services they needed BUT...\\nToday those numbers are much different...\\nHere\'s how the numbers break down today:\\nBut here\'s the 1st potential killer for you...\\nThat\'s right. The only people who really go past page 1 are researchers. Consumers will more than likely run a new search before they go to page 2 to see more results. \\nSo if you aren\'t on page 1 of Google, what are your chances of getting found by people looking for what you offer? If you said, \'slim to none\' you are correct. And since you realize that, you can get started now with Google Local the \'right way\' and step on your competitions throat. But before you do...\\nHere\'s the 2nd potential killer for you...\\nGoogle only shows up to a max of 7 local businesses on page 1 for any given keyword phrase. Why is that such a huge problem you ask?\\nBecause chances are...\\n...you have more than 6 competitors in your area who do what you do, right? You may even have 70 competitors in your city and every single one of you are fighting for just 7 spots on page 1 of the world\'s most popular search engine.\\nGone are the days of the full page phone book ad!\\nBack in the day, if you really wanted to clobber all of your local competitors, you would get a full page color ad in the phone book...in the best position available and your telephone would ring all week long.\\nWell...Not any more!\\nGoogle Local Search is the Phone Book 2.0\\nThere is no doubt that being on page 1 of Google will do wonders for your business, especially as more and more of the world goes \'mobile\'. In fact, something like 40% of all mobile searches have \'local intent\'.\\nSo how do you get to page 1 of Google fast?\\nYup! You guessed it. THIS online training course, of course. So here are the 3 steps you need to take right now if you want to dominate the 1st page of Google in your local area.\\nNot to mention the joy you will feel when you know your competitors are green with envy & probably filled with a little bit of rage.\\nYou have a full 30 days to try the course out and if, for any reason, you are not satisfied with it. You don\'t feel like doing the work. You don\'t like the way I teach. Or you just need the money back to make the rent or mortgage payment. Whatever the case...\\nYou will get a complete refund...no questions asked!\\nThe last thing I want is your money IF you feel like you didn\'t get a huge amount of value from my training course.\\nBut I\'m not worried about that...\\nThis course is literally a step by step guide to get your business on page 1 of Google fast. And it\'s the same exact process my employees use to rank our own private clients (who pay us $500 per month by the way).\\nIn fact, I actually sit them down on Udemy when they first start and make them watch the course while they do the steps with a new client. The same thing you are going to do to get your business ranked, if you are up for the challenge.\\nCheck out the Free Vids below... \\nAwhile back, I put on a webinar for over 100 business owners who belong to the same Chambers of Commerce as I do and you can get access to it right now for Free.\\nI broke the webinar up into chunks to make it easier to go directly to a topic you are interested in. So check those out now before you get started with the course.\\nOh by the way...\\nThe audio quality of the training course is much better than the audio from the webinar. Sometimes those webinars don\'t give back the best audio. It\'s not horrible but the actual training is much more crispy clear.\\nI look forward to training you on Google Local Search so you can get your business to page 1 and enjoy the calls, leads and sales that come with it.\\nI will see you inside the course...\\n \\nKeith C\\n \\n'"

Students who do this course end up feeling better instantly, and start creating change in their lives instantly, just by applying the simplest of everyday algorithms in their everyday lives. (In 10 minutes you will know what I mean.) \\n  2. Students immediately start applying the power of one thing at a time to tackle the mastery of any goal; incrementally, marginally, successively.  \\n You want to become better at parenting? This course can help you. \\n You want to become a better leader? This course can help you. \\n You want to have a more successful business? It helps with that too. \\n Why? How? Really? \\n Yes, and it\'s all about making it as easy as possible, (but no easier!) \\n So, do you ever ask yourself, ""I KNOW I could be doing more with my life, but HOW?""  \\n Let\'s face it. You have a busy life with a zillion distractions... and this can lead to a loss of focus, and not getting what you want out of life. \\n You join the gym in January but by the end of February... \\n The guitar you bought is in the spare room gathering dust... \\n You\'ve got a copy of \'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\' on your bookshelf, you know it\'s a great book yet you haven\'t opened it since 1995... \\n You decided to learn French, and after 3 weeks you\'ve not got very far and so you decide that maybe Spanish would be better...and 3 years later you\'re still just speaking loud English whenever you go abroad... \\n Sound familiar? You\'re not alone. Most of the population is in the same boat as you. It\'s pretty normal. Only a tiny percentage of the people on the planet have the self-discipline of an Olympic athlete. \\n And I for one, am certainly not in that group. I don\'t have an iron will. I don\'t even have a tin will. My will is probably more like cardboard if I\'m honest. \\n Therefore the standard approach to achieving your goals just doesn\'t really appeal to me, since the standard approach involves ME having to change. \\n  The standard approach is basically just \'have more self-discipline\', just \'get better\'.  \\n That\'s why I created a different approach. One that works for me, for (almost) all of us. And I didn\'t even have to do that much as the great Benjamin Franklin had already done most of the work. I just added a few tweaks, made it even more accessible and added a few thought algorithms to make it even easier to implement. \\n This approach is to use a system that gets the job done with minimum willpower, this approach involves not having to change. \\n So, you have two options: \\n 1. Change \\n 2. Be yourself + Use a System \\n  Choose easy. Choose Option 2. Make the smart choice. Take the red pill. \\n So, instead of increasing our willpower, let\'s use a system that works with a minimum amount of will. We\'re still going to have to do the work, it\'s just that we won\'t have to use up any of our energy forcing ourselves to do the work. \\n I\'m not afraid of work. In fact, none of us are really afraid of work. We\'re afraid that we won\'t stick at things because that\'s what we\'ve done in the past. We\'re afraid that if we try we might fail, and so after a while, we\'d rather not try. \\n We\'re afraid we\'re not good enough. \\n We\'re afraid we don\'t have enough willpower. \\n We\'re not afraid of doing the work, we\'re afraid that our work won\'t work! \\n   \\n  So, the big question is what\'s going to be easier for you? \\n Carrying on the same way, making resolutions, getting disappointed, giving up on yourself, starting to wonder if you\'re ever going to get what you want out of life? \\n Or using a system that gets it done with minimum willpower. \\n Get involved - enrol in the course and join nearly 80,000 students who are already finding that there just might be a better way... \\n ________________ \\n Oxford Physicist, Internationally Published Author and \'Thought Engineer\', Tom Cassidy, has created a system for helping people crack the deepest issues of their lives: self-worth, self-belief, goal-achieving, feeling good, achieving sustainable health and deeply fulfilling relationships. \\n Tom has combined the wisdom of hundreds of years of the study of global philosophies, human effectiveness, modern findings of behavioural science, recent breakthroughs in the understanding of brain physiology and even the results of quantum mechanics into a practical system for getting things done. \\n The system takes \'One thing at a time\' to a new level: it\'s monotasking-on-steroids. And best of all, it requires the least willpower of anything you\'ve ever tried. Other than sitting on the couch, of course! \\n It\'s basically the shizzle is what I\'m saying... \\n'"

"https://www.udemy.com/course/laughter/","The Yoga Of Laughter: From Stressed Out To Blissed Out! | Udemy","['Health & Fitness', 'Yoga']","[]","courses","b'Has life become too serious for you? Do you find yourself going days or weeks without laughing?\\nI certainly used to. I was in a job I hated and that filled my head with negativity and my body with rigidity.\\nIn 1998 while in Mumbai, India, I read a newspaper article about a group of people that gathered every day in a nearby public park to laugh. It piqued my interest because they shared no jokes and didn\'t use any form of comedy. Instead they laughed purely for the sake of feeling good, just because.\\nI was puzzled but chose not to go and investigate. It would have taken a full one hour, and I was too busy complaining I was too busy. I mean, why would sane adults do this anyway? What was the point? This was ridiculous and they had to be crazy. Anybody can laugh like that. Ha ha ha. Done.\\nI quickly forgot about it all, and was so convinced I could laugh anytime anywhere that it took me 6 years to realize that I never did.\\nEventually my heart took me back to Mumbai and its laughter clubs. I learned to laugh every day as a yogic practice using an exercise regime created by a medical doctor in 1995 called Laughter Yoga. This was a big turning point for me. I discovered how good laughing could make me feel and how easy it was to laugh, even when everything in my life seemed to be going astray. It was so profound that it triggered a cataclysmic reaction in my brain. The mask fell. I stopped being who I thought I should be and started being who I really wanted to be. I learned to always take full responsibility for my actions and how they made me feel. This\xc2\xa0did not change my life. It still is much better than that. It changed me.\\nThe more I practiced and taught this exercise regime, the more I discovered complementary techniques that help to bring joy into everyday life. I also started to understand the underlying wisdom from both the East and the West that all these techniques pointed to. In time I combined this knowledge into a method that I call Laughter Wellness. It includes the Laughter Yoga approach of simulated laughter exercises, and expands its approach by offering a clear process that is easy to follow, and adding a greater variety of\xc2\xa0techniques and activities, insights, games, dances, songs and more \xe2\x80\x93 all glued together with lots of laughter.\\nThis introductory course will introduce to you the founding principles and key techniques of Laughter Yoga and the Laughter Wellness method, and\xc2\xa0how they can help you as an individual laugh more (we won\'t go into how to teach group sessions).\\nNo particular equipment, clothing, or physical abilities are required.\\nWhat your personal history is doesn\'t matter. Who you are now is perfect and most appropriate.\\nAll can practice and benefit, with or without limbs, because this method revolves primarily around the breath and attitude (it\'s of course going to be more fun if you have limbs because these allow for more movements.)\\nAll you need is a big smile and the willingness to try something new that only adds and doesn\'t take anything away.

We will answer questions related to the exercises that are covered in this program, not every possible dog training question that might be out there.\\nAbout Treatpouch.com's Trainers\\nJulie Posluns\\n\\nAfter graduating from a correction-style dog training program in 2003, Julie got a new puppy \xe2\x80\x93 a Pug Beagle X (Puggle) named Tyson. At 8 months Tyson started barking and lunging at people, at 10 months he became leash reactive towards dogs, by 1 year he had full out aggression towards puppies. When Julie realized that she had not learned proper techniques to deal with aggression \xe2\x80\x93 punishing Tyson for his behaviour made him lash out with greater intensity, she started looking for new ways to help her dog. Clicker training brought a new light to Tyson\xe2\x80\x99s aggression and gave Julie a skill-set to manage his behaviour. This inspired Julie to learn about positive reinforcement training and set her on the path to becoming a professional positive reinforcement dog trainer.\\nJulie is a Certified Pet Dog Trainer, Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA) through the Certification Council for Pet Dog Trainers (CCPDT). As the owner of a successful dog walking company in Toronto, Julie sharpens her training skills daily when she is out on her group walks. When she\xe2\x80\x99s not dog walking you can find her teaching tricks to her own dogs.\\nBoth her dogs have titles in Rally Obedience and Freestyle but her greatest accomplishment is being able to bring her Puggle out with her on group walks. Treatpouch.com is her way of sharing with the world both the power of positive reinforcement training and the joy that comes from working with your dog.\\nJulie is currently pursuing her Master's degree in Animal Behavior, at Memorial University, in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.\\nAndre Yeu\\n\\nAndre\xe2\x80\x99s passion for dog training began when he rescued his beagle, Duke, who suffered from on-leash reactivity and dog-aggression. Andre quickly discovered clicker training and the power of positive reinforcement, and through patience and care was able to help Duke overcome his fear and dislike of other dogs.\\nDuke\xe2\x80\x99s success gave Andre the confidence to volunteer and foster with a number of animal rescue organizations in the city. While each foster dog presented new challenges every dog could be helped through clicker training.\\nIn 2009, Andre decided to open When Hounds Fly! in Downtown Toronto, to make positive reinforcement training convenient and accessible to members of the community, and to improve the quality of life for dogs and dog owners in the downtown core. With the success of his school and the transformation he\xe2\x80\x99s seen in the neighbourhood dogs, Andre decided that it would be a worthy cause to offer people the benefits of positive reinforcement based training regardless of where they live. Through Treatpouch.com Andre hopes to improve the lives of dogs and their people all over the world.\\nAndre is a Karen Pryor Academy Certified Training Partner (KPA CTP), a Certified Pet Dog Trainer, Knowledge Assessed (CPDT-KA), and a Truly Dog-Friendly Trainer. He grew up in Vancouver, has a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in commerce, with honors, from the University of British Columbia, and lives in Toronto with his partner, Hyedie Hashimoto, and their rescue beagles, Duke and Petey.\\n\\n\\n"""

Facts are facts and you deserve to hear it like it is... \\n And here it is, it\'s the real problem in the Internet Marketing community. \\n 94% of marketers make $500 or less online each and every month  \\n (and a large percentage of those make nothing or even lose money) \\n But why is that? Surely if everyone\'s buying the latest and greatest marketing tactics & strategies and the newest shiniest \'1 click to riches\' software, they should all be stinking rich shouldn\'t they? \\n Why are there so many people failing?  \\n Think about it like this... Most marketers aren\'t lazy or stupid people, heck to set up your own business takes a desire and passion that most average people lack... So if they set out to achieve the internet marketing dream (a lifestyle of complete freedom and passive income) Why is the reality nothing like that at all? \\n Well here\'s the cold, hard truth:  Most online marketers simply end up experiencing confusion, they spend way too much on crap \'systems\' that don\'t work, they make meager or non existent profits and end up completely overwhelmed. \\n (People get desperate to achieve success and they keep buying product after product without sticking to one thing long enough to even see a glimmer success - Or they simply get sold garbage, untested ideas by the conmen and fake ass \'gurus\' that are only interested in making a quick buck!) \\n And if any of this sounds familiar to you or has happened to you before you have to understand it\'s not your fault. It\'s simply the nature of the industry. \\n But look - If you\'ve found yourself stuck in the trap of always learning and never doing, (and feel overloaded by all those offers that hit your inbox everyday), there is a REAL, PROVEN solution... \\n The real secret is that there is no secret, there is no ""magic bullet"". \\n You just need to focus on actually building a real, evergreen business that works!  \\n And to do that (despite the constant hype) the best solution is to choose a business model that has worked in the past, that still works now and will continue to work for a long time in the future. \\n The reality is that the Internet is simply a tool and when you use it the right way you can leverage it to build a business, and a faster, smarter and better business! \\n The trouble is that until now no one has been showing people how to do this - \\n And that\'s why I\'m so excited to introduce you to the Faster, Smarter Better Business Building System... \\n Armed with this powerful internet marketing training you\'ll have nothing left to figure out on your own. Everything is laid out for you in true step-by-step action list format and it\'s all geared up to you finally getting the results you\'ve always wanted FAST! \\n Inside you\'ll get a complete system: \\n \xe2\x97\x8f You\'ll know exactly what business to start \\n \xe2\x97\x8f How to get an unlimited amount of free traffic. \\n \xe2\x97\x8f How to create killer evergreen products that are guaranteed to sell \\n \xe2\x97\x8f How to attract partners that will allow your business to grow really really fast \\n \xe2\x97\x8f How to put your business on autopilot \\n \xe2\x97\x8f And how to scale your business to any income level that you desire. \\n By the time you finish this internet marketing course you\xe2\x80\x99ll have learnt internet marketing and you\'ll own a ROCK SOLID, profitable business. \\n Your only decision will be to keep it or sell it. \\n Seriously you\'ll have a real asset, an asset that\'s worth selling for a lump sum of money. \\n How would you like a thirty thousand dollar payday? What would you do with that much cash? \\n Think about this right now: What\'s it worth to you to have the skill to build a business that could produce that type of money on demand... \\n ... Or to own a profitable evergreen business, the type of business that we described earlier (high traffic website, thousands of subscribers, powerful JV partners and relationships) \\n Something that provides you with the total freedom to live the life you choose... \\n What are you waiting for... below you\'ll find we are giving away almost an entire hour of this course\'s life changing videos.

It's all about delivering value to others. \\n Indeed you can paraphrase the whole perspective like this: \\n If you're not currently as wealthy as you'd like, you just haven't worked out a way to give enough value to enough people. \\n So, where did the Science of Getting Rich come from? Wallace D Wattles published the book in 1910 as a culmination of all his studies and experiments in the science-based, monistic approach to life, the universe and everything. \\n It's certainly an unusual book. It is not widely known, yet it has more wisdom and practical advice in its 16 short chapters than everything else I have ever read, combined. \\n I have read (or listened to) this book over 1000 times and I keep getting more out of it, every time I read it, I get something new. The gift that keeps on giving. \\n So, why do I like it so much? \\n It advocates an approach that is so different from everything else I've ever read. \\n It's practical. \\n It's simple. \\n It's based on Science. \\n It works. \\n OK, so if it's so good, why hasn't anyone heard of it? \\n Well, it could be something to do with the writing style being pretty dense and unappealing, which is one of the reasons we've turned it into a course. \\n The other reasons we created this programme: \\n  We wanted to show how the science behind the book was a century ahead of its time. \\n  We wanted to give you stories that support how well it works for everyone we've used it with. \\n  We wanted to give you the TOOLS to make it easier to take action on the principles. \\n  We wanted to apply our 13x4 system for Advanced Mind Mastery to the Science of Getting Rich, in the hope that everyone around the world will get truly wealthy, rather than this be just 'a book they read once and thought was quite good.'  \\n (Read the book and see why we're not just completely out of our minds!!! ) \\n That old 'One Thing at a Time' idea again! \\n Anyway, have a look here at the preface to the Science of Getting Rich and see if you can get why we needed to modernise it a bit! \\n 'This book is pragmatical, not philosophical; a practical manual, not a treatise upon theories. It is intended for the men and women whose most pressing need is for money; who wish to get rich first, and philosophize afterward. It is for those who have, so far, found neither the time, the means, nor the opportunity to go deeply into the study of metaphysics, but who want results and who are willing to take the conclusions of science as a basis for action, without going into all the processes by which those conclusions were reached. \\n It is expected that the reader will take the fundamental statements upon faith, just as he would take statements concerning a law of electrical action if they were promulgated by a Marconi or an Edison; and, taking the statements upon faith, that he will prove their truth by acting upon them without fear or hesitation. Every man or woman who does this will certainly get rich; for the science herein applied is an exact science, and failure is impossible. For the benefit, however, of those who wish to investigate philosophical theories and so secure a logical basis for faith, I will here cite certain authorities. \\n The monistic theory of the universe the theory that One is All, and that All is One; That one Substance manifest itself as the seeming many elements of the material world -is of Hindu origin, and has been gradually winning its way into the thought of the western world for two hundred years. It is the foundation of all the Oriental philosophies, and of those of Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Schopenhauer, Hegel, and Emerson. \\n The reader who would dig to the philosophical foundations of this is advised to read Hegel and Emerson for himself. \\n In writing this book I have sacrificed all other considerations to plainness and simplicity of style, so that all might understand. The plan of action laid down herein was deduced from the conclusions of philosophy; it has been thoroughly tested, and bears the supreme test of practical experiment; it works. If you wish to know how the conclusions were arrived at, read the writings of the authors mentioned above; and if you wish to reap the fruits of their philosophies in actual practice, read this book and do exactly as it tells you to do.' \\n Wallace D Wattles, Author of 'The Science of Getting Rich' \\n Take this Science of Getting Rich course now and learn how to become rich. \\n"""

I am so glad I did not listen to her advice and started a Level 1 course. I know I would not have been successful in the job if I did not have the knowledge I\'ve learned here. Also, I used Microsoft Word everyday throughout my career so it was nice to learn the style and multi-level numbering features (I didn\'t expect this--a nice treat). Also, I was totally clueless about charts and graphs, X axis and Y axis, etc. This course offered way more than the $200 I paid.

The techniques are not hard to understand, but still require the finesse and deliberate approach that is required when using artificial lighting.\\nWe will look at natural light from all angles; full sun, modified sun, shade and moody, emotional light. \\nWe will build some inexpensive modifiers for natural light, and also show how to correctly use white reflectors, silver and gold reflectors, scrims, mirrors, and more. These tools are not expensive, but the results they give can be astounding.\\nThe natural light fashion/beauty photography course is divided into 12 lectures, each running approximately 30 minutes. There is a workbook, plans for building a scrim and large reflector, and lots of videos.\\nMost lectures include a shoot with the gear we are using, a Photoshop tutorial, the PSD file for viewing and a look at how the final images were selected. Looking at the images as they are shot, and then edited, is very powerful as a learning tool.\\nIf you are interested in portraiture, fashion, beauty or glamour, this natural light photography course will open your eyes to the very cool ways you can use natural light to make your images.\\n \\nThe beauty photography course is suited to any level of photographer. I recommend a light meter, although we will also show you ways to use your camera meter as we go. A couple of stands would also be a good addition to your natural light arsenal.\\nThis class also has over two hours of bonus content, with new content being added in May 2013 and June 2013.\\n'"

"https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-guitar-in-21-days/","Free Guitar Tutorial - Learn Guitar in 21 Days | Udemy","['Music', 'Instruments', 'Guitar']","[]","courses","b'\\nMost beginners think that you need to know thousands of chords to play thousands of songs. NOT SO! You really only need to know a handful of chords and a few strumming patterns to play thousands of rock, folks, blues and pop songs.\\nThe reason guitar is the most popular instrument on the planet is because it\'s the quickest and easiest instrument to learn how to play. You do NOT need to read music. You do NOT need to learn music theory. You do NOT need to struggle through exercises, or practice scales, or learn how to play Mary Had A Little Lamb.\\nFact is that thousands of popular songs can be played with 8 simple chords or less. Learn just the A chord, D chord and E chord and you\'ll be able to play hundreds of blues, folk, pop and rock songs. Why is this so? Because rock, pop, folk and blues songwriters all use the same handful of chords - it\'s their melodies and arrangements that make their songs distinctive, NOT the chords they are using in the song.\\nSo, if you learn that handful of chords, and learn those few strumming patterns, along with the basics of holding and tuning a guitar, then you too will be able to play thousands of songs. And that\'s the simple truth.\\nWorld renowned guitar educator Ravi has taught thousands of people to play their favorite songs on guitar with his breakthrough 21-day course. The ""trick"" behind this course is really no trick at all; over the 21 days you\'ll learn how to hold and tune the guitar, how to play eight simple chords, how to strum, and how to keep a beat.\\nNo gimmicks. No ""magic"" formula. No nonsense.\\nYou will need to set 20 minutes a day aside for your practice sessions. No more and no less. And you are asked to do this for 21 days straight. Yes, you can skip a day or two but the daily repetition and practice regiment is the key to your success.\\nRavi has also included additional lessons for you to work with beyond the 21 days. You\'ll learn more open position chords, the moveable barre chord system (worth the price of admission alone!), how to read chord charts, and how to easily and quickly learn songs from sheet music, song books and lyric sheets that you download from the internet.\\nRavi will step you through the course and each of your practice sessions on the video lessons. Follow the course for those 21 days and beyond and we guarantee that you\'ll be prepared to start playing and building your own repertoire of favorite songs to accompany yourself or play in a band setting.\\nNo, you will not be an Eric Clapton in 21 days and we wouldn\'t suggest you book your first gig on the 22nd day BUT you will be a guitar player and you will be well equipped to learn ALL of your favorite songs.\\nIf you\'ve always wanted to learn to play guitar so that you can strum along and sing your favorite songs, Learn Guitar in 21 Days is likely the answer you\'ve been seeking. Grab your guitar, boot up Ravi\'s first lesson and let\'s start making music right away!\\nNOTE!\xc2\xa0We get asked all the time why a guitar educational company with so many advanced courses would offer such a simple solution to learning guitar without having to learn how to read music, learn theory or work through a more ""formal"" learning methodology. The answer is really simple; you never stop learning music but you do have to start. If your introduction to music is boring, tedious and generally a struggle, you\'ll likely pack the guitar up in its case and stick it in the closet. If it\'s fun, engaging and you can prove to yourself that you can really do it, then you\'ll spend a lifetime enjoying and learning guitar. Hopefully, TrueFire and our massive library of instruction will enhance that lifetime of enjoyment.\\n\\n'"

His method is based on science, and he has achieved amazing results while coaching professionals from companies such as: Goldman Sachs, GE, J P Morgan, Google, Bloomberg, eBay, The Wall Street Journal, Sage, The Walt Disney Company, KPMG, Ernst & Young, Thomson Reuters, Adecco, Lloyds Bank, Citigroup, PwC, HSBC and O2. \\n Alex Garcez discovered that your brain loves speed, and he thinks that fast is fun - slow is boring! If you think you have short attention span to read books, documents and social media, then you probably read slowly and carefully. Instead of understanding the text you get bored and distracted, needing to skip back to re-read text countless times. The main reason is that your brain is too powerful to go at such a slow pace and will drift off into something more interesting to think about. \\n You will assess your reading speed at the beginning and throughout the course. So, if you spend 3 hours reading at work and improve your reading speed, on average, by 33%, you will save a whole month of work every single year. \\n You can find more information at his website. \\n Please Google ""The Speed Reading Coach"" \\n This is what you\'ll cover during the training course: \\n Take this speed reading course now, improve your reading skills and save your valuable time! \\n This is a 4 Hour course.

If so this free course is for You.\\n\\nAbout the Course:\\nIn this course we will start with basics of Geodatabases and Shapefiles. We will also learn how to build data pipelines (theory and sample script) that can be utilized to populate database tables and/or update existing data in an Enterprise Geodatabase. Skeleton script sample has been provided as a starting point to enable the student to understand how such a data pipeline can be built using Python. This pipeline once built can be run periodically on a schedule to perform batch processing of data every day or even every 5-10 minutes. This approach allows for near real time update of data. Changes to the data are reflected on the services published via ArcGIS Servers and made available to clients. The services published to the ArcGIS Server are independent of the updates to the data in the Geodatabase. \\nInformation on important considerations for working with Geodatabases has also been provided. We will also look at how ArcToolbox can be utilized to work with Geodatabases.\\nIt is important to note, we will not cover publishing or updating Hosted Servers which make use of the black box hosted data store. The focus of this course is on Enterprise Geodatabases. If your architecture includes an Enterprise Geodatabase then this course will be of particular interest. However developing data pipeline using Arcpy or ArcGIS API for Python may be adopted for Hosted Server.\\n'"

Not only that, but they are continually developing this plugin and adding new features requested by customers.\\nHowever, although there is a lot of written documentation provided to purchasers of this plugin, we are visual learners and do much better when seeing something in action rather than reading through a \xe2\x80\x9chow to build a form\xe2\x80\x9d series of web pages.\\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just us. Because we own the developer license and we use this on many clients sites, there were numerous times when site owners wanted to use the plugin to create an additional web form for their business and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to use Gravity Forms. It was then that we started including \xe2\x80\x9chow to build a web form\xe2\x80\x9d videos for our clients, and it turned out that they were visual learners too.
